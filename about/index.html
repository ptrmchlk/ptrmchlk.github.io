  <p>Hi! My name is Piotr.</p>

  <p>I’m an <strong>evolutionary biologist</strong>, working mainly using mathematical models and computer simulations to understand the complexity of sexual selection and conflict.</p>

  <p>I completed my <a href="https://hal.science/tel-05023183/">PhD</a> at the University of Toulouse with <a href="https://crbe.cnrs.fr/annuaire/ferdy/">Jean-Baptiste Ferdy</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=VhsB4z0AAAAJ&amp;hl">David Duneau</a>, where we studied the     <strong>role of seminal fluid proteins in sexual conflict</strong>. Together, we developed, to my knowledge, the only biologically grounded mathematical model describing how male proteins influence female physiology. Contrary to the prevailing picture, our results suggest that when females can use those proteins as cues, <strong>sexual conflict is reduced</strong>.</p>

  <p>Although my PhD focused on mathematical modelling and programming, my roots are in biology. I studied biology in Poland and Sweden, observed halfbeak behaviour from tricky videos, and conducted experiments with beetles and flies. Running experiments made me face the complexity of biology and that we need theory (mathematical or not) to really grapple with what’s happening underneath. And so I try my best to develop a little of that theory.</p>

  <p>Currently, I’m focused on finishing my PhD papers, and in my spare time, I increasingly think about the evolution of post-copulatory sexual signals.</p>
