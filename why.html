    <p> Well, partially. The internet I grew up with was a bit of a noisy mess, overpopulated with dancing gifs.</p>
    <p> The actual reasons for the minimal websites are:</p>
    <p> One - I like the aesthetics of it. The most obvious reason. I find it calming and silent. </p>
    <p> Two - I know, more or less, what is here. I'm know very little HTML, but what is here I generally understand. The initial website was using the nice Jekyll generated templates. But I enjoy working on it more in pure HTML. </p>
    <p> Three - Maybe because it is this direct interaction with HTML, it feels more unmediated and human, even if simple. An in the age of the rampant <a href="https://thebullshitmachines.com/lesson-1-autocomplete-in-overdrive/index.html">auto-completion</a>, I find it just nicer.  </p>
    <p> Four - Sometimes, for no good reason, I use text based browsers like Lynx. Or simplistic like Dillo. A website like this is clear and accessible. </p>
