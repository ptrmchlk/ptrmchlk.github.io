  <p> Well, partially. If we're honest, the internet I grew up with was a bit of a noisy mess, overpopulated with
    dancing gifs.</p>
  <p> The actual reasons for the minimal websites are:</p>
  <p> One - I like it. The most obvious reason. I find it calming. And silent.</p>
  <p> Two - I know, more or less, what is here. I'm know very little HTML, but what is here I generally understand. Sure, for full-blown profesionnal website, there are tools like Hugo and Jekyll. But for a small one like this, I
    enjoy working on it more using pure HTML.</p>
  <p> Three - Maybe because it is this direct interaction with HTML and CSS, but it feels more unmediated and human. An in the age of the rampant <a href="https://thebullshitmachines.com/lesson-1-autocomplete-in-overdrive/index.html">auto-completion</a>, I find it just nicer. </p>
